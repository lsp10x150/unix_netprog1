When we run the program, there is no output. To prevent accidental reception of multicast datagrams that a server is not expecting, the dernel does not deliver multicasst groups to a socket that has never performed any multicast operations (e.g. joining a group). What is happening here is that the destination address of the UDP datagram is 224.0.0.1, the all-hosts group that all multicast-capable nodes must join. The UDP datagram is sent as a multicast-capable nodes must join. he UDP datagram is sent as a multicast Ethernet frame and all the multicast-capable nodes receive the datagram since thay all nelong the group. However, the kernel drops the received datagram since the process bound to the daytime port has not set any multicast options.
