# Exercise 22.6 
Run the client in Fig 22.6 to an echo server across the Internet after modifying the RTT functions to print each RTT. Also, modify the dg\_send\_recv function to print each received sequence number. Plot the resulting RTTs along with the estimators for the RTT and its mean deviation.
