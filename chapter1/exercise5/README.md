# Exercise 1.5 
Modify Figure 1.9 as follows: First, change the prot number assigned to the * sin_port * member from 13 to 9999. Next, change the single call to * write * into a loop that calls * write * for each byte of the result string. Compile this modified server and start it running in the background. Next, modify the client from the previous exercise (which prints the counter before terminating), changing the port number assigned to the * sin_port * member from 13 to 9999. Start this client, specifying the IP address of the host on which the modified server is running as the command-line argument. What value is printed as the client's counter? If possible, also try to run the client and server of different hosts.
