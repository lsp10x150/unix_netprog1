# Exercise 2.5 
A connection is established between a host on an Ethernet, whose TCP advertises and MSS of 1'460, and a host on a Token Ring, whose TCP advertisies an MSS of 4'096. NEither host implements path MTU discovery. Watching the packets, we never see more than 1'460 bytes of data in either direction. Why?
