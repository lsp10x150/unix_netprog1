# Exercise 11.9 
In Section 7.5, we discussed port staling with the SO\_REUSEADDR socket option. To see how this works, build the protocol-independent UDP daytime server in Fig 11.19. Start one instance of the server in one window, binding the wildcard address and some port of your choosing. Start a client in another window and verify that this server is handling the client (not the printf in the server). Next, start another instance of the server in another window, this time binding one of the host's unicast addresses and the same port as the first server. What problem do you immediately encounter? Fix this problem and restart this second server. Start a client, send a datagram, and verify that the second server again from a different login account on the first server to see if the stealing still succeeds. Some vendors will not allow the seond bind unless the user ID is the same as that of the process that has already bound the port.
