# Exercise 11.4
Run Fig 11.4 specifying a dotted-decimal IP address as the hostname. Does your resolver allow this? Modify Fig 11.4 to allow a dotted-decimal IP address as the hostname and a decimal port number string as the service name. In testing the IP address for either a dotted-decimal string or a hostname, in what order should these two test be performed?
