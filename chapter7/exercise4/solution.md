The first client calls setsockpot, bind and connect. But between the first client's calls to bind and connect, if the second client calls bind, EADDRINUSE is returned. But as soon as the first client connects to the peer, the second client's bind will, work, since the first client's socket is then connected. The only way to handle this is for the second client to try calling bind multiple times if EADDRINUSE is returned, and not give up the first time the error is returned.
