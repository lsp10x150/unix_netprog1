Only two segments are exchanged, not four. There is a very low probability that the two systems will have timers that are excatly synchronized; hence, one end's keep-alive timer will expire shortly before the other's. The first one to expire sends the keep-alive probe, causeing the other end to ACK this probe. but the receipt of the keep-alive probe causes the keep-alive timer on the host with the slower clock to be reset for two hours in the future.
