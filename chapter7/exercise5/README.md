# Exercise 7.5
Obtain the source code for the examples in this book (see the Preface) and compile the sock program (section C.3). First, classify your host as (a) no multicast support, (b) multicast support but SO\_REUSEPORT not provided, or (c) mulicast support and SO\_REUSEPORT provided. Try to start multiple instances of the sock program as a TCP server (-s command-line option) on the same port, binding the wildcard address, one of your host's interface addresses, and the loopback address. Do you need to specify the SO\_REUSEADDR option (the -A command-line option)? Use netstat to see the listening sockets.
