# Excersise 7.2
Modify figure 1.5 as follows: 
 Before calling connect, call getsockopt to obtain the socket receive buffer size an MSS. Print both values. 
 Afterconnect returns success, fetch these same two socket options and print their values.
 Have the values changed? Why?
 Run the program connecting to a server on your local network and also run the program connecting to a server on a remote network. Does the MSS change? Why?
 You should also run the program on any different hosts to which you have access.
