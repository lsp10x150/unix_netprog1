The only one time a peer that you would be setting up an association with would be able to send back data is if it had DATA pending BEFORE the connection was set up. This would occur if each side was using the one-to-many style and each side did a send to implicitly set up the association. This type of association setup is called an INIT collision, and details on it can be found in Chapter 4 of [Stewart and Xie 2001]
