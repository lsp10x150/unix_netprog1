No, the final two segments of the connection termination sequence are not sent. When the client sends the data to the server, after we kill the server child (the "another line"), the server TCP responds with an RST. The RST aborts the connection and also prevents the server end of the connection (the end that did the active close) from passing through the TIME_WAIT state.
