Our server awaits textual data, looking for LF symbol marking the end of the line sent by the client. Binary file can contain null-bytes which the server will interpret as the end of the null-terminated string and LF symbols.
Answer from the answers section of the book: 
Our client/serveer programs do not work with a binary file. Assume the first 3 bytes in the file are binary 1, binary 0, and a newline(LF). The call to fgets in Figure 5.5 reads up to MAXLINE-1 characters, or until a newline is encountered, or up through the EOF. In this example, it will read the first three characters and then terminate the string with a null byte. But, our call to strlen in Figure 5.5 returns 1, since it stops at the first null byte. One byte is sent to the server, but the server blocks in its call to readline, waiting for a newline character. The client blocks waiting for something that will never arrive from the other one. The problem here is that fgets signifies the end of the data that it returns with a null byte, so the data that it reads cannot contain any null bytes.
