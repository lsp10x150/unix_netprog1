# Exercise 5.1
Build the TCP server from Figures 5.2 and 5.3 and the TCP client from Figures 5.4 and 5.5. Start the server and then start the client. Type in a few lines to verify that the client and server work. Terminate the client by typing your EOF character and note the time. Use netstat on the client host to verify that the client's end of the connection goes through the TIME_WAIT state. Execute netstat every five seconds or so to see when the time state ends.What is the MSL for this implementation.
