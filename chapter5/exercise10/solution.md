In the first scenario, the server blocks forever in the call to readn in Figure 5.20 because the client sends two 32-bit values but the server is waiting for two 64-bit values. Swapping the client and server between the two hosts causes the client to send two 64-bit values, but the server reads only the first 64 bits, interpreting them as two 32 bit values. The second 64-bit value remains in the server's socket receive buffer. The server writes back one 32-bit value and the client will block forever in its call to readn in Figure 5.19, waiting to read one 64-bit value.
